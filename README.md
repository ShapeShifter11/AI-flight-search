# AI-flight-search
## flight search routine using AI-style searching method

program is developed in Ubuntu Linux

When started the program will ask the user from where does he want to fly. 
You can chose from the following cities:

- Denver
- New York
- Chicago
- Los Angelis
- Houston
- Urbana
- Calgary
- Toronto

The algorithm first searches the database for a direct flight between the selected destinations and displays `to` and `from` and the `distance`.
If there isn't a direct flight between the selected destinations the algorithm displays the rout with the least distance between them and the transfer destination in the middle.
